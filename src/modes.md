# Modes

WTy2 is designed to be a language which can be implemented very efficiently, and give programmers control over performance. At the same time, WTy2 is not Rust: implementing a full-on borrow checker and requiring all references to track lifetimes in WTy2 programs seems excessive. To try and strike a middle-ground, WTy2 takes inspiration from some of the recent work Jane Street has done with OCAML <https://blog.janestreet.com/oxidizing-ocaml-locality/>, <https://blog.janestreet.com/oxidizing-ocaml-ownership/>.
